# RGB LED 2Pins

A simple sketch on how to used `2pins RGB LED` in Arduino and using [**LM358**](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm158-n.pdf) microcontroller for PWM output.
Using C# windows application that control the color of the LED. Through voice recognition translated into text-command and then send into serial.
